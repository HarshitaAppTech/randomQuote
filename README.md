# randomQuote
Get a random quote from [lukePeavey/quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) api

This app uses [hilt](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-hilt) for dependency injection
I also tried my best to follow ViewModel pattern with data binding
Iâ€™m also using Material3 (Material You) in this project

This project is also updated with help from [OpenAI's Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex). I'm taking advantage of this AI assistant for learning and experimenting with code changes.
