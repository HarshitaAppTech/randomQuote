# randomQuote

RandomQuote is an **Android** app that fetches a quote from the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable). It is written in Kotlin and makes use of **Hilt** for dependency injection, Retrofit for networking, and **ViewModel** with data binding for UI logic. The project also adopts Material Design 3.

This repository is periodically updated with help from [OpenAI's Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) for learning and experimentation.
